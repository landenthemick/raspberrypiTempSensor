Code for displaying DHT11 or DHT22 data

This file is not made to be excecuted, it is simply educational. I used this code for my 10th grade personal project (personal projects are a part of the IB diploma) This code would be used to display data from a DHT11 or DHT22 to either a SSH terminal or a LCD display. The wiring and setup is shown below:
